**my name is ayaan**
**I'm just starting out in programming, and I'm really interested in learning how to build simple programs and understand how code works. Right now, I'm focusing on the basics of C because it helps me learn the core concepts like variables, loops, and functions. I enjoy solving small problems with code and seeing how small changes can create different results. My goal is to get more confident with programming and eventually build useful and fun projects.**
